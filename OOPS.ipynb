        "- Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n",
        "- OOPs Concepts:\n",
        "  - Class\n",
        "  - Objects\n",
        "  - Data Abstraction\n",
        "  - Encapsulation\n",
        "  - Inheritance\n",
        "  - Polymorphism\n",
        "  - Dynamic Binding\n",
        "  - Message Passing\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "  Imagine representing a \"car\" in a program. In OOP, you would create a \"Car\" class with attributes like \"color,\" \"model,\" and \"speed,\" and methods like \"accelerate,\" \"brake,\" and \"turn.\" This class encapsulates the data and behavior of a car, and you can create multiple car objects, each with its own attributes and behaviors, based on this class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.What is a class in OOP**\n",
        "- A class is a collection of objects. Classes are blueprints for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) can have.\n",

        "        class Dog:\n",

        "- Abstraction and encapsulation are distinct but related concepts in object-oriented programming:\n",
        "- Abstraction:\n",
        "  focuses on hiding implementation details and presenting only the essential features or functionalities of an object to the user. It answers the question \"What does this object do?\" without revealing \"How does it do it?\" Abstraction is achieved through mechanisms like abstract classes and interfaces, which define a contract for behavior without providing the complete implementation. An example is a car's steering wheel and pedals, which abstract the complex internal mechanisms of driving.\n",

Polymorphism enhances code organization, reduces redundancy, and simplifies the addition of new functionalities.\n",

        "  - Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding): This type of polymorphism occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass \"overrides\" the method in the superclass. When the method is called on an object, the actual implementation invoked depends on the object's type at runtime.\n",

        "    - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "              class Parent1:\n",
        "                  pass\n",
        "\n",
        "              class Parent2:\n",

        "                  pass\n",
        "  - Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
        "    - When a method is called on an instance of a class with multiple inheritance, Python uses a specific order to search for that method in the inheritance hierarchy. This order, known as the Method Resolution Order (MRO), prevents ambiguity when parent classes have methods with the same name. Python's MRO is determined by the C3 linearization algorithm.\n",
        "  - Flexibility and Code Reusability:\n",
        "    - Multiple inheritance can be used to create complex class hierarchies and promote code reuse by allowing a class to aggregate behaviors from various sources.\n",
        "  - Potential for Complexity:\n",
        "    - While powerful, multiple inheritance can introduce complexity, especially when dealing with the diamond problem (where a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor, leading to potential method duplication). Careful design and understanding of MRO are crucial to avoid issues.                  \n",

        "**19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python**\n",
        "- The __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python are special methods (also known as \"dunder methods\" for their double underscores) that define how an object is represented as a string. They serve different purposes and are aimed at different audiences:\n",
        "- __str__ (for users):\n",
        "  - This method is intended to return a \"user-friendly\" or \"readable\" string representation of an object.\n",
        "  - It is called implicitly by functions like print(), str(), and format() when an object needs to be converted to a string for display to a human user.\n",
        "  - The output should be concise and easily understandable, potentially omitting some internal details for clarity.\n",
        "- __repr__ (for developers/debugging):\n",
        "  - This method is intended to return an \"unambiguous\" or \"developer-friendly\" string representation of an object.\n",
        "  - It is called when an object is inspected in the interactive interpreter, by the repr() function, or as a fallback when __str__ is not defined for a class.\n",
        "  - The output should ideally be a string that, if passed to eval(), would recreate the object, or at least provide enough information to unambiguously identify the object's state for debugging purposes.\n",
        "- Example:\n",

        "- The super() function in Python is a built-in function that provides a way to access methods and properties of a parent or sibling class from a child or subclass, particularly in the context of inheritance.\n",
        "- Key Significance:\n",
        "  - Method Overriding and Extension:\n",
        "    super() allows a subclass to call a method of its parent class, even if the subclass has overridden that method. This enables extending the parent's behavior rather than completely replacing it. A common use case is calling the parent's __init__ method from the child's __init__ to ensure proper initialization of inherited attributes.\n",
        "  - Code Reusability and Maintainability:\n",
        "    By using super(), you can avoid explicitly naming the parent class when calling its methods. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain, especially if the class hierarchy changes.\n",
        "  - Multiple Inheritance and Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
        "    In scenarios involving multiple inheritance, super() plays a crucial role in correctly navigating the Method Resolution Order (MRO). The MRO defines the order in which Python searches for methods in a class hierarchy. super() ensures that the next method in the MRO is called, preventing issues and ensuring proper execution flow in complex inheritance structures.\n",
        "  - Forward Compatibility:\n",
        "    super() promotes more robust and forward-compatible code. If a parent class's name or structure changes, code using super() will often adapt more seamlessly than code that explicitly references parent classes.\n",
        "- In essence, super() is fundamental for effective and robust object-oriented programming in Python, especially when dealing with inheritance and complex class hierarchies.\n",
        "- Example:\n",

It allows you to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected. This method can be particularly useful for releasing external resources such as file handles, network connections, or database connections that the object may hold.\n",
        "- Overview the Python __del__ Method\n",
        "  - Purpose: The __del__ method is used to define the actions that should be performed before an object is destroyed. This can include releasing external resources such as files or database connections associated with the object.\n",
        "  - Usage: When Python's garbage collector identifies that an object is no longer referenced by any part of the program, it schedules the __del__ method of that object to be called before reclaiming its memory.\n",

        "- The @classmethod decorator is a built-in function decorator that is an expression that gets evaluated after your function is defined. The result of that evaluation shadows your function definition. A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance\n",

        "- A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. This method can't access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.\n",
